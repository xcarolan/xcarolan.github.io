One of my wife's pet peeves is when people continuously complain about something without making any effort to do something about it. Although I agree, I wouldn't say it was one of my pet peeves—maybe because I'm guilty of that behavior too. Aren't we all?

And so I find myself complaining continuously about the state of politics today in the U.S. In this I am not alone. Day after day the administration commits actions that undermine democratic norms and institutions. I've struggled to understand how so many people can vote to put in power an administration that seems to care so little about the Constitution, the rule of law, and the American people themselves.

Yesterday I learned that a CDC advisory panel voted to [remove the recommendation for universal hepatitis B vaccination of newborns](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/06/childhood-vaccine-hepatitis-b)—a vaccine that has for decades saved countless lives and has been proven highly effective. The panel, now stacked with anti-vaccine activists appointed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was condemned by leading pediatricians and vaccine experts as a "parody of public health." Dr. Paul Offit, a respected vaccine expert, called the decision a "clown show," noting that it "shortens children's lives." The Supreme Court, meanwhile, continues to issue rulings that seem more interested in partisan outcomes than impartial justice. The list goes on and on.

I found myself needing to do something, but what is there to do? The Republicans have turned into a Trump loyalty cult, abandoning any sense of representing their constituents. The Democrats are themselves heavily influenced by big business and external interests. They appear to have no strategy; indeed, there appears to be no desire from political leaders to fundamentally address our systemic issues.

So I attended a Democratic social event recently—the first political party event I've ever attended. I wanted to get a sense of the strategy, the grassroots organization and activism. I was, to put it bluntly, thoroughly disappointed.

Candidates for upcoming elections were on their soapboxes giving the usual "vote for me" spiel. There seemed to be no sense of unity, no sense of genuine concern, and no attempt whatsoever to improve voter engagement. For example, I noticed there were no young people in attendance. Attracting and engaging young and upcoming voters is key to change. The event felt like going through the motions rather than building a movement. Needless to say, I doubt I will be attending another event, and yet something needs to be done.

### **Finding a Different Path Forward**

I recently read Bradley Tusk's book on mobile voting, and it set me thinking differently about the problem. Tusk argues that mobile voting could dramatically increase turnout by making voting as accessible as mobile banking. The technology exists, uses end-to-end encryption, and could particularly help voters with disabilities, rural voters, and military personnel overseas. The U.S. has an abysmal voter turnout record, especially for local and state elections. The only way I can see to overcome the rampant gerrymandering taking place is to engage ALL voters. Of course, many politicians oppose this—higher turnout threatens the status quo that keeps them in power.

Tusk's book set me on a mission. Could his ideas work? As an engineer, I wanted to look at the code (it's open source) and see a demo. I was disappointed to find there was no public demo—no way for potential voters to actually test and experience the concept. After much searching, I found the open source backend software on GitHub: [VoteSecure](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure), Free & Fair's core cryptographic library for the Mobile Voting Project. But there didn't seem to be a front end—something potential voters could try and rally behind. Without that, there will be no voter pressure on electoral bodies to adopt the technology. As it stands, I found one company that "sells" the front-end software to electoral organizations. I considered building my own front-end as a demo to illustrate the concept, but parked that idea for now.

### **A More Immediate Solution**

I shifted my thinking. There's a lot of misinformation and outright lies everywhere—on social media and even in mainstream media. How are voters expected to sort fake stories from real ones, especially when those stories are constructed specifically to engage and enrage people?

Maybe the solution is simpler: ignore the noise and just look at the cold, hard, boring facts. Analyze how politicians are actually voting on issues and compare that to their campaign promises. I thought this might be an approach that could work.

I started building a solution to extract data from my local North Carolina government—information that's readily available about House and Senate representatives. I next looked at extracting voting records for each representative to compare them with their campaign promises. This research led me to WeVote, an independent volunteer organization that attempts to bring clarity to elections, issues, and ballots.

### **Taking Action**

I've also served as an election officer here in Raleigh. Working the polls gave me a front-row seat to how democracy actually functions at the ground level. I've seen firsthand the dedication of poll workers who show up at 5:30 AM to ensure every eligible voter can cast their ballot. I've also seen the challenges: outdated equipment, confusing procedures, and the occasional voter who arrives misinformed about where or how to vote. But mostly, I've seen ordinary citizens doing the essential work of democracy—and I've realized that this work desperately needs more people willing to step up.

I've joined WeVote as a volunteer. I'm glad it's independent and nonpartisan. Their approach is to compile endorsements for candidates, with the thinking that voters can make informed decisions based on which organizations—that they personally trust—have endorsed which candidates. While I'm still evaluating whether endorsements alone provide enough context, what impressed me was the organization's rigor and the passionate volunteers driving it forward. They're not telling you how to vote—they're giving you tools to make informed decisions based on your own values. That in itself is a huge win.

As the 2026 midterms approach, it's critical that voters understand their vote really does make a difference. Every vote counts, especially in local and state elections where margins are often razor-thin. Organizations like WeVote are trying to cut through misleading and fake information and bring clarity to elections.

### **My Challenge to You**

Don't complain about the state of government and sit on the sidelines. Here's what you can do:

- **Support organizations like WeVote** ([wevote.us](https://wevote.us/donate)) that provide nonpartisan voter information
- **Volunteer as an election officer or poll worker**. See how democracy actually works from the inside. Every county needs more workers, and you'll gain invaluable perspective on the voting process
- **Vote in every election**, not just presidential years. Local elections often have the most direct impact on your daily life
- **Help others vote**. Talk to friends and family about making a plan to vote

I started by complaining. Then I got disappointed. Now I'm engaged. My wife would be proud. The question is: what will you do?
